## :pushpin: Abstract
The study focuses on developing a cluster tracking robot for logistics purposes, aiming to resolve the existing issues of high sensor costs and limited object recognition accuracy in traditional tracking robots. In this study, we use YOLOv7-Tiny, an optimized and lightweight deep learning model for the Jetson Orin Nano, to enhance object recognition accuracy. By controlling the robot's direction and speed solely using depth information obtained from Intel's RealSense camera, we address the high-cost issues associated with mass production of these robots and aim to solve traffic accident problems involving logistics vehicles.
